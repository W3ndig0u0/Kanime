                  <h1 class="reviewText">Highly enjoyable with an interesting world view. While not all the characters
                    were highly interesting, the secondary characters felt real and like they had a deeper story behind
                    them with their wants and despairs, even if they were shallow, not everything has to be deep.
                    Especially relatable when the main character chose to ignore some truths and not realize them in
                    full as that realization would put a dampener on the story and would take it in a completely
                    different direction.

                    This anime was a breath of fresh air with a female protagonist I can relate to unlike everything
                    else that came out this season in a similar genre. Would love more female leads in the future that
                    do not revolve around romance or saving anything in a cringy manner! Would love it even more if the
                    FM did not have an ML 'aiding' in her journey.

                  <h1 class="reviewText">I think people are not looking into this show as much as they should. I've read
                    many reviews talking about the story being lackluster and the animation being the only thing that
                    enticed them but I have to disagree. with definitely a few plot holes and a lot being left up to
                    interpretation Wonder Egg's story is a true mind-fuck if you actually think about it. Though many
                    find the plot quite complicated it's actually quite simple when taking a closer look. I really
                    enjoyed the characters and the different personalities and problems each faced making them seem so
                    different yet so similar all at the same time.

                    I do think the story could be slightly refined and cleared up so the plot wasn't as messy but I
                    really enjoy the psychological element to it, my only honest complaint is that it was short and I
                    would've liked it to be longer!!!

                    A total mindfuck yet so good!!!!! I'm really looking forward to the specials :)

                    that is 2 words that describe the show.
                    it feels like a show for people that has never talked to another human being, frankly its insulting
                    that this show even has this high of a rating.

                    i felt like i wasted days of my lives basically understanding the fantasy dreamland of a otaku that
                    has no hope recovering.
                    its kinda sad that this is their fantasy although you could just put some effort into learning how
                    to communicate and into your looks instead of blaming genetics and fantasising about something
                    you'll never have.

                    the rating of the anime made me feel bad for these people, and the anime itself is just taking
                    advantage of the lust within these people which i find insulting as a fellow human being.

                    chemistry, the show became easily one of A-1 Pictures’ best works. On top of that, it was helmed by
                    an acclaimed director of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, Shinichi Omata. Not only did he return for a
                    second season, but the show would be adapting material manga fans consider to generally be better
                    than what the first 12 episodes covered. With such lofty expectations, it’s difficult to see how a
                    show would really top itself, at least until you see it in action.

                    Visually speaking, it’s an absolute oddity. There are moments where the show tries to escape its
                    blander art style and delve more into something different and more appealing, only for most of the
                    show to retain what it had before. The inconsistency between these two styles reminds me of the
                    strange and ever-shifting artwork quality in Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig. Said
                    instability may be the weakest aspect of the show’s visuals outside of the inconsistently handled
                    CGI, but if that’s the worst aspect, then the show’s still among the best in the studio’s catalog
                    from a visual perspective. Shinichi Omata and his team have decided to play with the medium even
                    more than last time. Were the optical illusion backgrounds not enough? Then the show will play with
                    aspect ratios and screen filters, even having jokes where a character’s hand gestures affect both
                    the screen size and loudness of the audio. The show will sometimes shift styles entirely for the
                    sake of certain gags, such as when the show obtains a shoujo manga art style or switches to a
                    fighting game perspective. Each new technique the show fiddles around with feels purposeful and for
                    the sake of bolstering the show’s visual gags and overall stellar comedy. The animation itself is
                    even more fluid in the first season as well and the show hasn’t forgotten how to make genuinely
                    gorgeous shots, either.

                    Kei Haneoka’s music has not faltered much, either. There are not too many new standout tracks this
                    season, but the few there are take a less comedic approach, such as “close attendant” and the track
                    “birthday” which has a more grandiose and emotional feel to it. That singular track is perhaps a
                    personal favorite for the entire series up to that point. The OST at times has a more emotion-driven
                    feel to it, which fits the direction the season takes. The gag “opening” sequence in the shoujo gag
                    from episode 7 is also one of the show’s multiple vocal tracks which are all good in their own
                    right. Lastly, w I am no fan of the ED, the OP, “DADDY! DADDY! DO!” by Masayuki Suzuki feat. Airi
                    Suzuki is a fun, jazzy bop that rivals that of the first season.

                    With the audiovisuals out of the way, it’s time to get down to what makes season 2 a somewhat
                    different beast than its equally funny predecessor. Outside of the last 2 episodes, the first season
                    of Kaguya-sama was more about establishing its characters and their dynamics while planting the
                    seeds for things to come. Meanwhile, this second season can basically be split into 2 arcs with one
                    overarching story of Kaguya and Shirogane’s awkward romance cat and mouse games remaining a
                    constant. The first half of the season is about newcomer Miko Lino and the rivalry she develops
                    against Miyuki Shirogane during the student elections of the new school year. She’s a surprisingly
                    endearing new addition to the cast as an absolute hardass dork, though she certainly cannot compete
                    with the main 4. The second half focuses on the sports festival and what our main leads do to
                    prepare for and conquer it while Miko integrates into the main cast lineup. One thread tying these
                    two together is Ishigami, the dark horse from last season. He effectively comes into the forefront
                    for the bulk of the season with a compelling character arc that puts everything about him and how
                    certain characters react to him into perspective. If season 1 didn’t establish him as a personal
                    favorite of mine, then these 12 episodes most certainly have.

                    This isn’t to say the rest of the cast doesn’t pull their weight. The series has always been
                    incredible at continually expanding on its characters and their dynamics. Kaguya’s progression
                    towards being increasingly vulnerable and adorkable when it comes to her cat and mouse romance with
                    manwhore Shirogane is as priceless as Shirogane’s arcs with her or how the show spotlights more
                    times he has to be brought down to learn something new. Chika, who usually teaches him these things
                    at the cost of her own physical and mental health, has been relegated to more of a dark horse
                    position this time as her agent of chaos moments have been dialed back. Seeing her get more violent
                    and frustrated is also an absolute joy to witness. Even outside of these characters, Ai Hayasaka’s
                    growing frustration and humiliation over Kaguya’s embarrassing behavior regarding Shirogane is
                    wonderful to witness. Other characters such as Tsubame and Shirogane’s dad have their own moments to
                    shine as well whenever Shirogane’s and Ishigami’s arcs come to the forefront. It’s safe to say that
                    by the time the inevitable season 3 rolls around, the show will have established quite the
                    ever-expanding ensemble cast. Of course, some of their humorous antics would not be the same without
                    the over the top voice acting and outstanding directing present, but it’s clear that Shinichi Omata
                    and his team are working with a manga that really has a way with writing both main and side
                    characters.

                    It’s not hard to see why fans of the source feel that the series gets better over time. Not only did
                    this season put into perspective a lot of the character dynamics and gags from season 1, it also
                    amped up its bombastic presentation from both a visual and voice acting perspective. What could have
                    just been more of the same instead stepped up to deliver an astounding sophomore season of perhaps
                    my favorite anime comedy at the time of writing. Its sweetest and most heartfelt moments are even
                    more endearing and powerful than before while the chaotic, over the top comedy remains rock-solid
                    for those who liked it beforehand. Can the narrator sometimes overexplain things when he’s at his
                    best when riffing on the main cast? Absolutely. Is the pacing a bit weird at times with there being
                    more chapters and gags put into each episode? Perhaps. However, that’s not enough to derail top-tier
                    writing or uproarious presentation. Here’s to a third season in 2021 where the show will vie for the
                    title of AOTY for 3 years in a row. The quaint finale cannot be the end.

                  <h1 class="reviewText">Clannad is a really heartfelt anime about a group of friends bonding over various issues, whilst grappling with their past and gradually building their bonds with each other. The main character, Tomoya, feels like a persona protagonist with even more sass, but he is by no means a bad character. 

                    Animation and sound, while simplistic, is very solid and there is very little wrong with it. 
                    
                    The one big complaint i would have with Clannad is that one character, arguably the most compelling of the bunch, gets almost written out of the show entirely, and the writers never give them closure.
                    
                    Overall. however, Clannad is a great time filled with memorable characters and while it feels like arcs slapped together, it's easy to immerse yourself in said arcs and have a great time.

                  <h1 class="reviewText">There is a good reason why Demon Slayer is so popular because Studio ufotable does a wonderful job with the animation, the characters are endearing and the story is engaging. The action is beautifully done thanks to the great animation and it just leaves you wanting more. There is not much to fault with Demon Slayer, yeah it's got it's dark, bloody moments and a few characters might not be your cup of tea but overall it's an Anime worth the time with only 26 episodes including a well executed film. One thing is it might not be a long running Shōnen since the manga has already come to an end.

                <div class="reviewScroll">
                  <h1 class="reviewText">Was so hyped when they said there will be new series in Naruto universe. I watched Naruto read manga played Naruto ultimate ninja storm on Pc and PSP and wasted way too much time on Naruto online(can say im kinda fan of this universe).

                    When i saw Boruto Movie i was still hyped about series since main team with Boruto Sarada and Mitsuki looked promising and balanced for new story. I knew they going to put same story from the movie into series and i was happy that series didnt started with it and had it own start  and it entroduced us new characters and new ˇworldˇ where technology advanced sadly it advanced way too fast for idk 10-15 years. And so the problems began to ocure to me as fan as well setting didnt fell as well as in Naruto. The more you watch it the more it feels like its not a ninja style anime anymore. Another problem accured with powerlevel i know they said it like 10321651321564 times that younger generations are stronger then old once but it feels more like the old generations at some point stop training at all and at some point i was wondering that there might be generation that will have babys strong as madara ... And that is not the only problem with powerlevel other villiges feel even more weak then Konoha for some reson wich doesnt make sence (maybe cose im old) but they cant be weak like that cose Naruto said hey we friends so chill and i do all the work...(could talk more about it but  it would take a lot of time to said it to the tinyest details.)
                    
                    But the biggest problem of Boruto is story like it or not story is way too streched and out of lets say 10 chapters 8-9 are filler like. Thanks to that a lot of characters becoming more and more annoying, yes there are some cool episodes but if you tell someone that he needs to watch 20-30 episodes to watch one good well he thinks of you that ypu are insane. Becouse before that cool episode you need to watch how one character is coocking then next character is going shopping then we go look how someone is going to pick his kid from kindergarden... you get the point. i dont mind good fillers but this sucks hard there are way too many of these so watching it weekly is out of question. The best way to watch it without wasting your time is watching some clips of it on youtbue and you wont miss anything from main story. On this site Filler Boruto i found that Boruto has over 70% fillers so uhmm.. theres no way it gets over 5/10 for story...
                    
                    Animations feel stiff and for series that is one of the most loved and still cant make it look great it is like ..l.. to its fanbase. Same goes for artsily it feels like avarege artstile in animes again for such a big series it should not be like that.
                    
                    Music feels same like in Naruto. 
                    
                    Characters  as i mentioned before they dont feel as bad in early but with more fillers comming they just feel more annoying since i want main story to continue but i have to watch them insted...
                    
                    Overall Boruto feels like when u going to your favourite restaurant and they start to serving you sht and with good cake would dyou go there again sht or just for cake. If you say yes for sht and cake then you prob love boruto if just for cake you like boruto but see mistakes and skipping fillers or you can just go somewhere else to eat and then you just gave up on the show.

                <div class="reviewScroll">
                  <h1 class="reviewText">Yes, this anime is leaving so many different opinions in the anime community. It launched so many new memes and divided the world into two best-girl-teams and left us with questions how do those robots even work. 

                    But regardless nobody really talks about its meaning beyond waifu wars and ecchi scenes. Because those scenes are really flashy it is difficult to see deeper meaning of this original anime. Its story is set up in the future, where people left the surface because of klaxosaurs - some kind of monsters which kill people. We meet main characters who are living in a big building which not only has houses but also environment similar to one humanity left behind. Therefore main heroes don’t know the beauty of the nature we are very familiar with.
                    
                    What is more it seems like they don’t know much about human relationships. They don’t know kissing, love, romantic relationships and many more. It seems they were born for one purpose only - for killing klaxosaurs and defending adults which once lived on the surface. After seeing 7th episode of this anime it was clear to me - this anime has promissing post-apocalyptic story which is bringing me so many questions: Is it like that in the whole world or only in Japan? Who are the children fighting against klaxosaurs? Are they part of experiment (If that is true the ending will maybe be closer to Kiznaiver - original anime from same anime studio)? What is the whole point behind not telling them what we are being taught as children (for example: about kissing)? Why is half kloxosaur fighting against klaxosaurs? And who is Hiro (the lead character)? Why is he so different than other adolescents?
                    
                    And if we are already talking about Hiro his story is in my opinion very psychological. He is different than others and he seems to know more than his friends. Because he talks about stars and rain and even names his team mates (they are given code names by adults) I imagine him living on the surface before, but I could be wrong. In adition he is an unique boy who is very friendly to others but when he grows up he for some reason can’t pilot his robot. This leaves him with emotional problems, stress and inability to control Franxx - robot. Since they don’t know counsuling this only leads to him training as hard as he can but doesn’t leave good results with his piloting. Somehow he losts purpose in life - because the only purpose of this adolescents is piloting Franxx and fighting those monsters.
                    
                    He could be seen as an example of anyone of us who suddenly lost purpose in life or is in very difficult emotional and stressful stage of their lives (for example: ending school and starting a job). And so he clings on the only person he can give him purpose he is searching for - Zero Two. She has kloxosaur’s blood and acts very differently than other girls. I persume she is far older than those adolescents, because she has a lower code name and has seen the humanity before it got almost extinct. She is the one who is leaving Hiro with many philosophical questions about life and humanity and gives him purpose again. But for what prize?
                    
                    So if I summarise my thoughts, Darling in the FranXX sure is centered on relationships and romance but it is more than that. It shows us what could our world be in the future. Apocalypse might not happen because of sudden appearance of monsters but because we are destroying our environment. We also could leave the surface of the Earth and run away in order to survive. And whoever comes after our time could forget what we knew, saw and did and like main characters in this anime be suprised by stars, sea, old buildings and an old book about having a baby (which was in my opinion the best symbolic object shown in the 7th episode).
                    
                    So overall its has a very good post-apocalyptic story but it's sadly hiddend behind the relationships which some find exaggerated or meaningless.
