                  <h1 class="reviewText">Highly enjoyable with an interesting world view. While not all the characters
                    were highly interesting, the secondary characters felt real and like they had a deeper story behind
                    them with their wants and despairs, even if they were shallow, not everything has to be deep.
                    Especially relatable when the main character chose to ignore some truths and not realize them in
                    full as that realization would put a dampener on the story and would take it in a completely
                    different direction.

                    This anime was a breath of fresh air with a female protagonist I can relate to unlike everything
                    else that came out this season in a similar genre. Would love more female leads in the future that
                    do not revolve around romance or saving anything in a cringy manner! Would love it even more if the
                    FM did not have an ML 'aiding' in her journey.

                  <h1 class="reviewText">I think people are not looking into this show as much as they should. I've read
                    many reviews talking about the story being lackluster and the animation being the only thing that
                    enticed them but I have to disagree. with definitely a few plot holes and a lot being left up to
                    interpretation Wonder Egg's story is a true mind-fuck if you actually think about it. Though many
                    find the plot quite complicated it's actually quite simple when taking a closer look. I really
                    enjoyed the characters and the different personalities and problems each faced making them seem so
                    different yet so similar all at the same time.

                    I do think the story could be slightly refined and cleared up so the plot wasn't as messy but I
                    really enjoy the psychological element to it, my only honest complaint is that it was short and I
                    would've liked it to be longer!!!

                    A total mindfuck yet so good!!!!! I'm really looking forward to the specials :)

                    that is 2 words that describe the show.
                    it feels like a show for people that has never talked to another human being, frankly its insulting
                    that this show even has this high of a rating.

                    i felt like i wasted days of my lives basically understanding the fantasy dreamland of a otaku that
                    has no hope recovering.
                    its kinda sad that this is their fantasy although you could just put some effort into learning how
                    to communicate and into your looks instead of blaming genetics and fantasising about something
                    you'll never have.

                    the rating of the anime made me feel bad for these people, and the anime itself is just taking
                    advantage of the lust within these people which i find insulting as a fellow human being.

                <div class="reviewScroll">
                  <h1 class="reviewText">TThe first season of Kaguya-sama: Love is War was a breakout success. With its
                    over the top direction and comedy along with its cast of well-rounded characters with amazing
                    chemistry, the show became easily one of A-1 Pictures’ best works. On top of that, it was helmed by
                    an acclaimed director of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, Shinichi Omata. Not only did he return for a
                    second season, but the show would be adapting material manga fans consider to generally be better
                    than what the first 12 episodes covered. With such lofty expectations, it’s difficult to see how a
                    show would really top itself, at least until you see it in action.

                    Visually speaking, it’s an absolute oddity. There are moments where the show tries to escape its
                    blander art style and delve more into something different and more appealing, only for most of the
                    show to retain what it had before. The inconsistency between these two styles reminds me of the
                    strange and ever-shifting artwork quality in Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig. Said
                    instability may be the weakest aspect of the show’s visuals outside of the inconsistently handled
                    CGI, but if that’s the worst aspect, then the show’s still among the best in the studio’s catalog
                    from a visual perspective. Shinichi Omata and his team have decided to play with the medium even
                    more than last time. Were the optical illusion backgrounds not enough? Then the show will play with
                    aspect ratios and screen filters, even having jokes where a character’s hand gestures affect both
                    the screen size and loudness of the audio. The show will sometimes shift styles entirely for the
                    sake of certain gags, such as when the show obtains a shoujo manga art style or switches to a
                    fighting game perspective. Each new technique the show fiddles around with feels purposeful and for
                    the sake of bolstering the show’s visual gags and overall stellar comedy. The animation itself is
                    even more fluid in the first season as well and the show hasn’t forgotten how to make genuinely
                    gorgeous shots, either.

                    Kei Haneoka’s music has not faltered much, either. There are not too many new standout tracks this
                    season, but the few there are take a less comedic approach, such as “close attendant” and the track
                    “birthday” which has a more grandiose and emotional feel to it. That singular track is perhaps a
                    personal favorite for the entire series up to that point. The OST at times has a more emotion-driven
                    feel to it, which fits the direction the season takes. The gag “opening” sequence in the shoujo gag
                    from episode 7 is also one of the show’s multiple vocal tracks which are all good in their own
                    right. Lastly, w I am no fan of the ED, the OP, “DADDY! DADDY! DO!” by Masayuki Suzuki feat. Airi
                    Suzuki is a fun, jazzy bop that rivals that of the first season.

                    With the audiovisuals out of the way, it’s time to get down to what makes season 2 a somewhat
                    different beast than its equally funny predecessor. Outside of the last 2 episodes, the first season
                    of Kaguya-sama was more about establishing its characters and their dynamics while planting the
                    seeds for things to come. Meanwhile, this second season can basically be split into 2 arcs with one
                    overarching story of Kaguya and Shirogane’s awkward romance cat and mouse games remaining a
                    constant. The first half of the season is about newcomer Miko Lino and the rivalry she develops
                    against Miyuki Shirogane during the student elections of the new school year. She’s a surprisingly
                    endearing new addition to the cast as an absolute hardass dork, though she certainly cannot compete
                    with the main 4. The second half focuses on the sports festival and what our main leads do to
                    prepare for and conquer it while Miko integrates into the main cast lineup. One thread tying these
                    two together is Ishigami, the dark horse from last season. He effectively comes into the forefront
                    for the bulk of the season with a compelling character arc that puts everything about him and how
                    certain characters react to him into perspective. If season 1 didn’t establish him as a personal
                    favorite of mine, then these 12 episodes most certainly have.

                    This isn’t to say the rest of the cast doesn’t pull their weight. The series has always been
                    incredible at continually expanding on its characters and their dynamics. Kaguya’s progression
                    towards being increasingly vulnerable and adorkable when it comes to her cat and mouse romance with
                    manwhore Shirogane is as priceless as Shirogane’s arcs with her or how the show spotlights more
                    times he has to be brought down to learn something new. Chika, who usually teaches him these things
                    at the cost of her own physical and mental health, has been relegated to more of a dark horse
                    position this time as her agent of chaos moments have been dialed back. Seeing her get more violent
                    and frustrated is also an absolute joy to witness. Even outside of these characters, Ai Hayasaka’s
                    growing frustration and humiliation over Kaguya’s embarrassing behavior regarding Shirogane is
                    wonderful to witness. Other characters such as Tsubame and Shirogane’s dad have their own moments to
                    shine as well whenever Shirogane’s and Ishigami’s arcs come to the forefront. It’s safe to say that
                    by the time the inevitable season 3 rolls around, the show will have established quite the
                    ever-expanding ensemble cast. Of course, some of their humorous antics would not be the same without
                    the over the top voice acting and outstanding directing present, but it’s clear that Shinichi Omata
                    and his team are working with a manga that really has a way with writing both main and side
                    characters.

                    It’s not hard to see why fans of the source feel that the series gets better over time. Not only did
                    this season put into perspective a lot of the character dynamics and gags from season 1, it also
                    amped up its bombastic presentation from both a visual and voice acting perspective. What could have
                    just been more of the same instead stepped up to deliver an astounding sophomore season of perhaps
                    my favorite anime comedy at the time of writing. Its sweetest and most heartfelt moments are even
                    more endearing and powerful than before while the chaotic, over the top comedy remains rock-solid
                    for those who liked it beforehand. Can the narrator sometimes overexplain things when he’s at his
                    best when riffing on the main cast? Absolutely. Is the pacing a bit weird at times with there being
                    more chapters and gags put into each episode? Perhaps. However, that’s not enough to derail top-tier
                    writing or uproarious presentation. Here’s to a third season in 2021 where the show will vie for the
                    title of AOTY for 3 years in a row. The quaint finale cannot be the end.
